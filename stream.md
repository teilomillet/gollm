You are implementing streaming possibilities in gollm. 
This needs to work for openai and anthropic for now, we'll see later for other usage. 

The goal for now is to implement a simple streaming features, just make it work with the specs of openai and anthropic in golang.

----

stream
boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to false
If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.

Messages
Streaming Messages
When creating a Message, you can set "stream": true to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).

​
Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and TypeScript SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.


Python

TypeScript

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

with client.messages.stream(
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
) as stream:
  for text in stream.text_stream:
      print(text, end="", flush=True)
​
Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. event: message_stop), and include the matching event type in its data.

Each stream uses the following event flow:

message_start: contains a Message object with empty content.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a content_block_start, one or more content_block_delta events, and a content_block_stop event. Each content block will have an index that corresponds to its index in the final Message content array.
One or more message_delta events, indicating top-level changes to the final Message object.
A final message_stop event.
​
Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of ping events.

​
Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an overloaded_error, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:

Example error

event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
​
Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.

​
Delta types
Each content_block_delta event contains a delta of a type that updates the content block at a given index.

​
Text delta
A text content block delta looks like:

Text delta

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
​
Input JSON delta
The deltas for tool_use content blocks correspond to updates for the input field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final tool_use.input is always an object.

You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a content_block_stop event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.

A tool_use content block delta looks like:

Input JSON delta

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from input at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an input key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple content_block_delta events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.

​
Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.

A stream response is comprised of:

A message_start event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains: a. A content_block_start event b. Potentially multiple content_block_delta events c. A content_block_stop event
A message_delta event
A message_stop event
There may be ping events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.
